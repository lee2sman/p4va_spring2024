### Sketchpad and the birth of the GUI

Ivan Sutherland invented the Graphical User Interface in 1963. Prior to this, you only interacted with a computer via switches or a keyboard. The sketchpad interface featured switches, dials, an output display and a lightpen that could draw directly on it. A user pressed switches while drawing. One switch allowed touching the screen with the lightpen to draw a line from the previous position on screen. Another switch drew circles. Another drew arcs. Etc. This allowed a user to draw directly on screen without having to specify position in code commands. There were also capabilities for duplicating, moving, scaling and rotating shapes on screen.

Sketchpad was a new way of working and contained constraints that shaped what could be created with the software. In the 80s as home desktop computers spread, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign became standard tools for manipulating photos and print design. These powerful tools have become standardized within creative industries. In the past few years they have added in scripting capabilities to extend the available tools within these software systems.

## Array 

An array is a list of similar objects, usually in a row or column.

Arrays have length. The length equals the total number of values in the array.

```
var students = ['Tasha', 'Ariel', 'Shona', 'Nat', 'Jerome'];
```

The **length** of students is 5 since there are 5 entries. **The first element is at index 0.**

```print(students[0]); // 'Tasha'```

Counting up from 0, we can see that the last element in the array is the 4th.

```print(students[4]); //'Jerome'```

Extrapolating from here, this tells us that the last element in any array is length - 1.

```
print(students[length-1]);
```

Choose a random student from an array

```
var pickAStudent = int(random(students.length-1));
```

### exercise

* Create an array with Young Thug, 100 Gecs, Lana Del Rey, Frank Ocean, Ecco2k, Baby Keem, ARca, FKA Twigs
* Write code to pick two random performers to headline together at Coachella

## Drawing a grid with loops

single line of rects with a single for loop

```
for (let x=0;x<width;x+=20){
    rect(x,height/2,20,20);
}
```

[code](https://editor.p5js.org/2sman/sketches/Rx5053gin)

## Loops in Loops

*The Grid: In and Out of Bounds*

```
let w = 30, h = 30;

for (let y = 0; y < height; y++){
  for (let x = 0; x < width; x++){
    fill(random(255),random(255),random(255))
    rect(x,y,w,h);
  }
}
```

Challenges:
- make a grid where each square is either black or white
- duplicate and make a new grid where each square is usually black, occasionally white

nested for loops

## Web-Based Artists Review

We'll talk about a few contemporary interactive media artists whose work lives on or dialogues with the Internet and whose work is built in code. 

Today we'll examine the work of:
